It might be a while before I get around to fixing/improving
some things, so I decided to start keeping a list so as not
to forget them:

---------------------------------------------------------------------
From Jes:
It isn't as easy as it should be to find the optimal parameters. This is 
> because the lattice sieve has been broken. It SHOULD print how many 
> special_q it has sieved when it completes a range, but is always says 0 
> special q. Chris, can you please fix this? It's quite annoying...

---------------------------------------------------------------------
From Kamada:
  He sent a patch to reduce the number of sqrt's done by the
Perl script when a number has more than 2 prime factors. This
should be integrated, but I have some similar useful code I wrote
a while back that should make it easier. So I need to merge the two
and apply it.
