  * Incorporated Cygwin compatibility fix by R. Backstrom
  * Workaround of GMP 4.2 bug - use GMP_BUG switch in makefile.
    (http://swox.com/list-archives/gmp-bugs/2006-May/000475.html)

6/8/06 (frmky)
  * Removed unused readRawS32() and writeRawS32() prototypes from ggnfs.h
  * Incorporate the patch by forzles to fix the odd exponent error
  * Silence the frequent, harmless warnings in the lattice sieve 
  * Change the extension of the plots from jpg to png to reflect that
    they are actually in PNG format

05/24/06 (BRG)
  * Updated VC++ version 8 build project to use GMP-4.2.1

05/13/06 (asl)
  * Some compartibility changes.
  * Merged latest patches by G.W. Reynolds & tested under mingw32.

03/16/06 (BRG)
  * Updated VC++ version 8 build project to include matrix save
    routines and to work with my current VC++ build for GMP 4.1.4

03/11/06 (asl)
  * Ported & tested matrix save\resume routines under mingw32.
    Maybe this will also work while compiled by Visual C++. ;)

03/10/06 (asl)
  * Added matrix save\resume routine by G.W. Reynolds.

02/02/06 (relf)
  * NEED_ASPRINTF, NEED_GETLINE are replaced with GGNFS_GNU_MISSING
  which is now defined in ggnfs.h
  * fixed all affected headers
  * WARNING: if GNU extensions are used, <stdio.h> should not be included directly
  but through ggnfs.h or at least after it

12/12/05 (trilliwig)
  * Header file fixes for Linux.

12/02/05 (relf)
  * matbuild-tpie.c merged with matbuild.c
  * matbuild.c minor cleanups

12/01/05 (relf)
  * file size/offset types changed to off_t
  * ULL_NO_UL is defined for 32-bit platforms
  * minor cleanups in mpz-ull.c
  * rel_list members became unsigned
  * readRawS32/writeRawS32 definition moved to ggnfs.h

11/16/05 (aSL)
  * Some factLat.pl changes by Mark Rodenkirch

11/04/05 (relf)
  * __ppc64__ is used together with __ppc__
  * GNFS_CS32 is removed, bc_t is defined as `unsigned long'
  * ULL_NO_UL is back, it must be defined whenever 'long long' is different from 'long'

10/30/05 (trilliwig)
  * Patched factLat.pl with Bob Backstrom's suggested change.  Updated q0-q1
    ranges are printed in ggnfs.log.
  * Minor update in misc.c to correct multiple printings of a status message.

9/30/05 (trilliwig)
  * It makes no sense to disable HAVE_FLOAT64 if HAVE_ASM_INTEL is defined.
    This causes pol51m0b to miss essential polynomials and causes the abnormal
    exit messages "lambda-comp" or "ull5a5p-comp".  The only bug that exists
    with both options enabled is that the compiled binary is completely broken
    if we allow compiler optimization with GCC 3.4.  This appears to be a bug
    with GCC 3.4, but disabling HAVE_FLOAT64 for MinGW is NOT a proper
    workaround because it leaves pol5 compiles broken on 32-bit Linux!  The
    correct workaround is disabling compiler optimizations for pol5 when
    GCC 3.4 is used.
  * Modified factLat.pl so pol5 errors are fatal errors again.
  * Modified matbuild so errors from checkMat() are not immediately fatal.
    The code is there to delete problematic rows, but it was never used
    because matbuild would exit unconditionally.  There is similar code in
    matsolve, but I think it is better to keep the hair-trigger exit there.
  * -Os is only beneficial for the lattice siever, and even then only on
    some machines (it is slower than -O3 on a Prescott).  Changed default
    CFLAGS to use -O3 and added -Os to CFLAGS in the src/lasieve4 directory.
    As an aside, using -funroll-loops and -finline-functions with -Os is
    counterproductive.

9/27/05 (relf)
  * -fmove-all-movables option removed as not supported by gcc 4.x
  * minor cleanups

9/25/05 (Sten)
  * Initial support for Win64 target (see VC8 solution files).
  * removed ASM_MPQS_SIEVER;ASM_MPQS_EVAL;ASM_MPQS_TD definitions from the
    VC8 projects properties for ggnfs-lasieve projects (currently asm-optimized
    versions do not work for some reason).

9/24/05 (trilliwig)
  * Ensure prand() returns a 32-bit quantity.
  * Added a -test mode to matsolve.  This will go into an infinite loop
    testing the MultB64() and MultB_T64() routines with the given matrix.
    This can help expose hardware errors or miscompilations.
  * Freed memory used in testMult().
  * Tweaked the status update message for Block Lanczos so it doesn't
    overflow the line.
  * Added dependencies for strip target.

9/18/05 (frmky)
  * Update blanczos-no-mmx.c to include multiplication tests and timing.

9/18/05 (trilliwig)
  * Changed char* variable basename to base_name (conflicts with the
    basename() library function).
  * Added Makefile rule for *.S files and changed *.s rule to use $(CC)
    (so I can easily add -m32 to CFLAGS when needed and have it work).
  * Added prescott target and cleaned up a few warnings.

9/16/05 (trilliwig)
  * Fixed type mismatch with rho_factor() causing procrels crashes on 64-bit
    machines.
  * mpz_poly_t.degree and getline() MUST be signed.  It is a bug if they are
    unsigned.
  * Added nocona target for Intel chips with AMD64 support.

9/15/05 (Brian Gladman)
  * minor fix for VC7 build files

9/10/05 (asl)
  * Some small fixes in the sprit of further "config" files.
  * Removed forceStop from ggnfs.h

9/3/05 (trilliwig)
  * Cleaned up some redundant compiler flags and defines.  In particular,
    -mtune is implied by -march.  Not to mention that in versions of gcc
    before 3.4, -mtune is not recognized (it was -mcpu).
  * Forced compilation flags for the Franke polynomial selection tools to
    use -O0 (no optimization).  Optimization breaks pol51* on Linux and MinGW,
    at least with gcc 3.4.  This allows us to use long doubles (HAVE_FLOAT64)
    under MinGW now, so that should mitigate the performance impact somewhat.
  * Changed getline() return type in src/if.[ch].  It must return a signed
    size (ssize_t).  This fixes the pol51m0b breakage under Linux.  Also
    added explicit typing of compute_root()'s argument in src/pol5/pol51m0?.c.
  * The lattice siever no longer opens ggnfs.log in binary mode, so those
    output lines should now be correctly terminated under Windows.
  * Removed bigint library specification as GMP from factLat.pl.  Apparently
    the GMP BigInt library is not available to Perl on some systems.
  * Modified factLat.pl to print q0 values to ggnfs.log at beginning of
    lattice sieve runs.
  * Added Brian Gladman's definitions of ssize_t to the MS portion of ggnfs.h.

8/29/05 (Brian Gladman)
  * added matbuild-tpie to the VC7 and VC8 build projects (could not do
    this for VC6 as I no longer use this version)

8/29/05 (Brian Gladman)
  * change to VC6, VC7 and VC8 build organisation to provide individual
    build directories (to avoid object file version conflicts)
  * copied Intel syntax assembler files from VC++ build directory
    to src\lasieve4\piii and src\pol5 so they are alongside their
    AT&T equivalents

8/27/05 (Brian Gladman)
  * change to VC6 and VC7 project files to make move to VC8 easier

8/26/05 (Brian Gladman)
  * minor update to correct an error in the VC++ project build files

8/24/05 (trilliwig)
  * Added LOCALINC to include paths in Makefiles for src/lasieve4/piii,
    src/lasieve4/ppc32, and src/pol5.  Anyone able to try if the itanium
    or mips lattice siever code works? :)
  * Added Makefile to tests/snfs_small
  * Eliminated _MSC_VER define when compiling under MinGW
  * Added copy of pol51-intel executables to a name without the suffix, so
    the factLat.pl script can still find them.  It really should be a
    symlink, but under MinGW, "ln -s" is a synonym for cp, and cp does not
    treat relative pathnames in the same way that ln does.
  * Fixed makesymlinks.sh

8/24/05 (relf)
  * lasieve-asm.h renamed to siever-config.h
  * 'ppc32' now linked to 'asm' (very much like 'piii')
  * Makefile's unified: no Makefile[.x86|.ppc|whatever] anymore
  * underscore problem fixed, ASM_UL removed
  * pol5/Makefile became $HOST-driven; "-intel" suffix removed from binaries

8/23/05 (Brian Gladman)
  * minor change to define strcasecmp as _strcmpi for VC++ and
    to include the 'fake' VC++ unistd.h file in if.c  Replace
	the define of _MSC_VER in ecm4c.c in order to simplify
	the use of a VC++ config file.

8/23/05 (Brian Gladman)
  * some minor changes to allow VC++ to use the inline version of
  	MULMOD32 instead of a subroutine (VC++ inline assembler can't
	deal directly with structures)
  * removal of special VC++ versions of if.c and if.h as the
    standard versions now work
  * changed a define in /piii/lasieve-asm.h	to be right way round
    (is now '#define modinv32 asm_modinv32', was reversed)
  * added {} brackets in gnfs-lasieve4e.c to avoid need for C99
    with an 'in-code' declaration

8/22/05 (asl)
  * Some code and defines cleanup in blanczos64.c

8/22/05 (relf)
  * Minor header fixes and cleanups
  * Applied Dmitri Gribenko's patches to Makefiles (w/ minor postfixes)
  * Makefile.ppc and Makefile.x86_64 now joined into Makefile since
    they do generic things while Makefile.x86 does x86-specific things
  * TODO: make single Makefiles for all targets

8/20/05 (relf)
  * example pol5/rsa512* moved to tests/rsa512_pol5/
  * lasieve4/piii/mpsq-hack.c moved to lasieve4/mpqs.c and shared
  * x86_64 siever now works
  * x86_64 assembler code is added to gnfs-lasieve4e.c (but it seems pointless)

8/19/05 (asl)
  * Renamed BIGENDIAN define to GGNFS_BIGENDIAN due to collision with
    winsock2.h

8/19/05 (Brian Gladman)
  * Lots of changes to restore broken VC++ compilation

8/19/05 (relf)
  * common code from lasieve4/ and pol5/ moved to src/ and shared
  * extra types definitions removed in favor of #including ggnfs.h
  * pol5 fixed with respect to suppost non-i386 platforms
  * most "(unsigned) long long" types changed to "(u)int64_t"
  * TODO: unify used types, e.g., use the same name for "u64", "u64_t", "uint64_t" etc.
  * compiled binaries are placed in bin/ directory

8/18/05 (asl)
  * Added some small snfs_test. tst250 runs something about 30 mins for me,
    so some quick test is required (F7 is still broken :)
    Thanks to Dmitriy Gribenko for .poly file.
  * Applied matbuild fixes to matbuild-tpie.

8/18/05 (trilliwig)
  * Updated Perl script to properly handle the knowndiv option from the
    .poly file when checking if sqrt has found all the prime divisors of N.
  * Removed include/version.h from repository.  A 'make' from the top-level
    directory should recreate it.

8/17/05 (asl)
  * Fixed mingw32 miscompilation.

8/17/05 (relf)
  * "out-of-box" support for x86_64 target
  * target can be specified in the master Makefile
  * fixed some minor problem with makefiles
  * some missed #include's recovered
  * major problems w/ gcc 4.0 compilation resolved
  * extra "%l" specificators removed
  * type conversion applied to printf() arguments where required
  * implicit function declarations made explicit
  * other minor issues fixed

8/15/05 (frmky)
  * Fixed a small typo in combparts_tpie.cpp.

8/12/05 (asl)
  * Fixed mingw32 miscompilation.
  * Changed "%lu" to PRIu32.
  * Integrated matbuild-tpie experimental package. Please read
    matbuild-tpie.txt in the experimental/ directory.
  * Some changes in optimization parameters. Added -ffast-math and
    increased function size for inlining. Got some speed-up.

8/10/05 (Brian Gladman)
  * Updated various files to repair the broken VC++ compilation
  * Added VC++ inline assembler to blanczos64.c

7/20/05 (asl)
  * Fixed some boundary cross bug in combinedSize().

7/17/05 (trilliwig)
  * Converted sources to use standard C9x int types defined in inttypes.h.
    Corrected a number of format specifiers for printf/scanf.  Changed
    a couple types here and there to correct possible problems.
  * Added check that the aligned memory functions actually return aligned
    memory in the MMX Lanczos code.

7/14/05 (trilliwig)
  * Patched factLat.pl so it automatically applies more generous parameters
    for SNFS factorizations where the polynomial degree is not optimal.
  * Reorganized mpz_fact_factorEasy() so the control flow makes more sense
    and doesn't repeat operations like trial division unnecessarily.

7/12/05 (trilliwig)
  * Updated mpz_fact_factorEasy() to check for higher multiplicity of prime
    factors above the trial division limit.  The DISC_P_DIV lines in
    ggnfs.log will also be written/interpreted accordingly.  This should
    fix some instances where procrels did not factor the discriminant of the
    polynomial as well as it could.
  * Added .params to the list of files cleaned in the gnfs-template Makefile.

7/9/05 (jasonp_sf)
  * Free unneeded arrays before the classical siever starts; reduces
    memory use by more than half for large factorizations
  * For the classical siever, set up each large factor base prime for
    the next sieve line immediately after the prime is used. Also
    collapse some operations scanning the sieve array. These two combine
    for a small speedup (~5%).

7/6/05 (frmky)
  * Applied a patch by Jason Papadopoulos to the classical sieve to fix an
    incorrect initialization when the factor base is very small (under
    65536).

7/5/05 (trilliwig)
  * Moved crossover for the Kleinjung/Franke poly tool a little lower, so
    Monico's poly tool doesn't try to make a quintic poly for 98-99 digit
    numbers.  Added Kleinjung/Franke parameters for 98-99 digits.

7/3/05 (trilliwig)
  * Used suggestion by G.W. Reynolds to raise murphymax values for pol5 to
    avoid memory issues in pol51opt.  It should have the added bonus of
    getting to the good polynomials faster.  However, there are still many
    instances remaining where pol51m0b dies with the message "lambda-comp"
    or "ull5a5p-comp".
  * Moved -wt option help text from matsolve to matbuild.  Also updated the
    Perl script to use the -wt option with matbuild, not matsolve.  Allowed
    "matsolve --help" to print help text if a depinf file does not exist.
  * Added support in the Perl script of lss and mrif parameters in the .poly
    file.  They correspond to $LATSIEVE_SIDE and $maxRelsInFF settings.
  * Tweaked some Makefiles so I don't always have to edit them extensively
    to use them in my environment. :)

7/2/05 (frmky)
  * Modified makesymlinks.sh to restore execute permissions to
    src/autogplot.sh and tests/factLat.pl
  * Applied a patch by Jason Papadopoulos to fix potential problems with
    64-bit 'a' values.

6/30/05 (trilliwig)
  * Smoothed out polynomial selection times for GNFS factorizations from 100
    to 135 digits.  The new default times range from 30 minutes for 100-digit
    factorizations to about 2 days for 135-digit factorizations.  The times
    for 136-155 digit factorizations are pegged at 2 days for now.  We don't
    actually expect people to use the script anyway for GNFS factorizations
    that large.

6/26/05 (frmky)
  * Added makesymlinks.sh to recreate the missing symbolic links after
    a CVS checkout.

6/26/05 (asl)
  * Applied some patches by Jason Papadopoulos to classic siever .
  * Fixed missing -wt command line flag for matbuild reported by G.W.Reynolds.

6/25/05 (trilliwig)
  * Added factorbase sizes and number of large primes encountered to summary
    file.

6/19/05 (trilliwig)
  * Fixed typo in error message in the lattice siever.
  * Applied Makoto Kamada's patch to suppress warnings in Miller-Rabin
    code if the Perl interpreter does not support 64-bit integers.
  * If M, Y1, and Y0 are all specified in the .poly file, the script
    will now properly use Y1 and Y0 to calculate the SNFS difficulty.
    It will also properly handle negative evaluated polynomial values.
  * Added much more paranoia in polynomial checking in the Perl script.
    It can be disabled by setting $CHECK_POLY to 0.
  * Added support for lattice sieving on the rational side.  This is
    controlled by the $LATSIEVE_SIDE setting.
  * Added some interesting information to the summary file.
  * Add client id to $PNUM, so if multiple clients are lattice sieving
    in the same directory, they don't all write to the same .last_spq*
    file.
  * Added Geoffrey Reynold's fix for bug when classical sieving is not
    done in multi-client mode.
  * Fixed runPol5() so it tolerates abnormal exits in the polynomial
    search programs.

6/12/05 (asl)
  * Extended 'a' field of relations to 64 bit. This seems to be enough
    to all decent middle-size factorizations. Big thanks to Andrei Belenko
    for this code.
  * Added custom malloc code (glibc dlmalloc). Now only for Mingw32.
    If anyone will test it on other platforms - let me know, or fix
    include by yourself.
  * Fixed makefiles for 'ln' under WinNT

0.77.1, 5/4/05
  * Two more little BSD fixes that I missed last time.

0.77.0, 5/3/05
  * Some BSD fixes. Things seem to be reasonably stable now.

0.76.9, 4/26/05
  * Some fixes to Makefile.ppc. But apparently there is still
    some ppc problem causing the lattice siever to crash.
  * Applied Kamada's patches for faster Lanczos and reducing
    the number of sqrts that the Perl script needs when there
    are 3 prime factors.

0.76.8, 4/25/05
  * Commented out an errant statement at line 746 of combparts.c
    which surely caused at least some of the matbuild/matsolve
    failures and crashes. It's not yet clear whether this is the
    only bug reponsible for the problems, but it was probably the
    major cause.

0.76.7, 4/21/05
  * I botched the fix that Kamada sent - I thought he had
    a typo in what he sent, but it was correct. I fixed it.

0.76.6, 4/20/05
  * Kamada pointed out that some conditionals in MultB64() and
    MultB_T64() were unneeded; indeed, I did not have them in
    there in earlier versions - I'm not exactly sure how they
    wound up in there (in blanczos64.c).

0.76.5, 4/13/05
  * Modified the mkLT() function to result in fewer mallocs, by
    accepting an input argument which can be reused for subsequent
    calls (and is, in fact, reused).
  * modified the mallinfo() calls so that they work on my linux
    box - the numbers I was getting before were flat wrong.
  * Modified the rest of combparts.c so that all allocate calls
    go through lxmalloc(), lxrealloc(), or lxcalloc(), so that
    we can keep track of the total number of calls.
  * Small fix in the Perl script ; in some situations, it would not
    restart from the correct q-value for lattice sieving before.

0.76.4, 4/13/05
  * line 206 of matbuild.c was wrong, and may have caused some segfaults.
    The right-hand side was changed from 'c' to '2*i+1'.
  * Added a sanity check/warning message to some fishy looking code
    in mkLT(), which seems to be causing problems for some folks during
    weight reduction.
  * Removed some leading asterisks from non-warning, non-error output,
    to make errors and warnings easier to spot on stdout. I would like
    to uniformize this so that errors and warnings follow some consistent
    convention which makes them easy to find.

0.76.3, 4/13/05
  * Modified Perl script to use polyselect on numbers < 100 digits
    instead of the Kleinjung/Franke tool (i.e., K/F is not appropriate
    there since degree 5 is too big)
  * Fixed a '#if' that should have been a '#ifdef' somewhere.

0.76.2, 4/12/05
  * Added a couple new lines to def-par.txt to go up to 126 digits
    (note, though, that the figures I supplied are guesses; but they
    should still be better than the choices resulting from using
    the 118 digit level).
  * Added a define in combparts.c to allow bypassing of the
    relation-set weight reduction.

0.76.1, 4/10/05
  * Finished the Perl script mods so that it does a reasonable
    job with classical sieving. It will now scan the logfile
    to see how much classical sieving has already been done,
    and resume if necessary.

0.76.0, 4/7/05
  * Some small changes to combparts.c and matbuild.c
    to try to combat the memory fragmentation problems.
  * Added lxalloc() and lxrealloc() which can also keep track
    of the number of calls and max heap useage. I will go through
    the code replacing malloc() and realloc() calls with these
    on a case-by-case basis.
  * Added Jason's fixes for the classical siever now - it seems
    to be working great. I made one small change for folks using
    pre 4.1.3 versions of GMP: line 298 of squfof.c, Jason used
    NULL for the second argument to mpz_export(), and this seems
    to only be supported for 4.1.3+, so I threw in a trash variable
    instead.
  * Added Brian's updates and pre C99 changes to clsieve.c.
  * Added a little hack to the Perl script to show how some classical
    sieving _could_ be done. It is not at all complete - there are
    some notes in the file as to how it might be completed, but I
    won't get to it for a while. But if you want to do a little
    classical sieving, you can either uncomment the relevent lines
    (990 and 991), or make/modify a job file and run the sieve
    program manually.

0.75.1, 3/26/05
  * Some small fixes to the Perl script to compensate for the new
    matbuild program. The script no longer looks for the depinf
    file, but uses spmat instead.
  * Included Jason's updates to the classical siever, but I seem
    to have broken it in the process (possibly because I applied
    the patch he send on 3/2/05 to the latest source tree which
    may have had too many changes and confused 'patch').
  * Removed the tests/F7 and tests/tst150 directories since the
    scripts in them were broken and I don't necessarily feel like
    fixing.

0.75.0, 3/24/05
  * Moved matrix pruning into the matbuild program. The matbuild
    program now does pruning of the matrix after building it,
    and stored the pruned matrix to file, along with a map that specifies
    how columns of the resulting matrix map onto original relaton sets.
      The benefit of doing it this way is that the parallelizing of
    matsolve will be greatly simplified. This meant some pretty significant
    changes in the overall structure, and the addition of new functions
    for saving and loading nfs_mat_t and llist_t data types.

0.74.2, 3/22/05
  * Another VC fix - the ggnfs.vc/lat_asm directory was accidentally
    omitted from the last release.
  * Finally added an lxmalloc() function and changed some malloc
    calls to use it. It is essentially just an xmalloc(), but it
    logs the error to the logfile as well.

0.74.1, 3/18/05
  * Included Brian's VC changes.
  * Included Sam's MingW32 fixes.
  * around line 870 of combparts.c : changed the default initialization
    size of 'R' to try and combat the large realloc() problems. I didn't
    think the new value through too carefully, so it still might be off
    (and still might now solve the problem completely, since there may
    be other default initialization values which similarly need to be
    changed). Someone (probably me, I suppose) should sit down and carefully
    work out reasonable heuristic values for these.

0.74.0, 3/16/05
  * As promised, I seperated out the cycle-counting and
    matrix-building code into a new program, `matbuild'.
    The plan is to eventually move the matrix pruning
    over into this program as well. But in the meantime,
    I hope this will make it easier to debug the memory
    problems occuring during cycle counting. There are probably
    still some scraps to be cleaned up, like functions in
    procrels.c which are no longer used. I will get around
    to doing a thorough house-cleaning on the code sometime
    this summer I hope.
  * Updated the Perl script to use this new program.


0.73.6, 3/11/05
  * Swapped order of command-line options for the lattice siever
    in the Perl script, to accomodate a bug in the Cygwin implementation
    of getopts (at least, it seems to be a bug there; in any case,
    it now properly parses the -n option).
  * Various cosmetic fixes to screen output.

0.73.5, 3/11/05
  * Lowered MAX_MERGE_OPS in comparts.c from 500000 to 100000.
    I don't know if the higher value was causing some of the
    memory problems on larger numbers or not, but 100000 is still
    pretty reasonable I think. I lowered a couple of other defaults
    by a little bit too, I think.
  * In llist.c, changed the statement
      maxShift = MAX(labs(shift), maxShift);
    to read:
      if (labs(shift) > maxShift)
        maxShift = labs(shift);
    I don't think this should have caused any problems, but I suppose
    that if labs() were implemented as a macro, some funny things
    could happen if my MAX or the labs() macro weren't coded just right.
  * Added a -prune option to procrels to cause it to remove a specified
    fraction of processed relations (i.e., the heaviest 10%, for example).
    Those relations will be first dumped to an output file in siever-output
    format, then removed from the binary files. This option has been lightly
    tested and seems to be okay.
  * Applied Tomoya's patch to procrels to remove heavy relsets at each
    makePass() and thus reduce RAM useage.
  * Added a heap-size checking function for debugging. This will no doubt
    cause problems on some platforms - on such platforms, just remove
    the -DMALLOC_REPORTING from src/Makefile, or write a replacement
    function in misc.c for mallocReport().
  * Added some debugging output in the event of memory allocation error
    in ll_catFields(). I don't know if it will help track down the problem
    or not, but it can't hurt. I suspect the problem is a boundary-overwrite
    one somewhere else, but it's going to require some seriously good
    memory tools to find it.
  * Added Rob's fixes/changes to the Perl script to chomp Q0 on
    restart and output the min # of FF's to the log file.
  * Small hack to the Perl script, setting PNUM=0 as a workaround for the
    Cygwin problem with parsing the -n option.
  * Added startup messages to the Kleinjung/Franke poly selection code.
    I sent Thorsten and email and got his okay on this first.
  * Added Brian's changes to version 0.73.4 for VC.

0.73.4, 3/1/05
  * Some of Sam's corrections to the Perl script.
  * Added a Cygwin fix for the Kleinjung/Franke poly selection
    code. We need to write a floorl() function for Cygwin. In the
    meantime, I added a #undef HAVE_FLOAT64 to circumvent the
    offending code on Cygwin. This may also need to be defined
    on MingW32 and/or VC if they don't have this function.

0.73.3, 2/24/05
  * Added Anton's MingW32 patches.
  * Added Tomoya's Cygwin patch of src/pol5/if.c.
  * Some small changes to pol5 code to hush compiler warnings
    (added prototype, remove/hide unused variables).
  * Added some of Brian's VC changes, but not all of them; it occurred
    to me that I was spending time integrating some changes which might
    already be broken.

0.73.2, 2/22/05
  * Added Sam's code to the Perl script which essentially completes
    the integration of the Kleinjung/Franke poly selection tool.
    (that is, except for multiple box support). It seems to work
    nicely on linux, though I'm sure there will still be some problems to
    be worked out on other platforms.
  * Added the interpolated parameter choices by Jes for the
    Kleinjung/Franke code (src/def-nm-params.txt).
  * Added the directory tests/template for gnfs factorizations.


0.73.1, 2/18/04
  * Included a fix by Eric in polyselect for the function
    sieveOverSimilarSize().
  * Integrated the Kleinjung/Franke polynomial selection
    tool (with non-monic linear polynomial).
  * Started adding capability to the Perl script to run the
    new tool. It's not done yet and certainly not tested yet,
    though it won't require too much more work.

0.73.0, 2/10/05
  * Another set of Sam's fixes for the Perl script
    (checking gnfs vs. snfs and setting the summary file name).
  * Return type for mulmod32() on PPC changed to s32, as per
    Tetsuya's suggestion (caused problems in procrels, where
    about half of the relations were being thrown out).
  * Some small changes to lasieve4/if.c and lasieve4/ppc/mpqs.c
    for PPC compatability, pointed out by Tom.
  * Implemented Eric's fixes in polyselect.c for deg >=6 polys.
  * Tweaked the default PRNG seeding in matsolve, to put a little
    more seperation between initial seeds in successive runs
    (note: this shouldn't really be needed if the PRNG's are
    any good at all, but it certainly cannot hurt to have this
    in case there is some bias on the low bits or something).
    Also, fixed a bug that broke manual seeding (had (+i) instead
    of (++i) ).
  * As per Anton's suggestion, modified the Perl script to
    pass the $minFF value on to procrels so that it doesn't
    do weight reduction and build column files unless we have
    the specified number of FF's (previously, it would do this
    if the matrix was overdetermined - but often, we want to wait
    until it is very overdetermined, so that pruning will shrink
    it more).

0.72.12, 2/1/05
  * Added some of Sam's fixes to the Perl script.
  * Added Sam's fix to gnfs-lasieve4e.c so that:
    (1) It will take fractional skew values.
    (2) The 64-bit constants are specified with trailing ULL,
        to hush compiler warnings in some environments (perhaps
        even errors in some environments??).
  * Changed the default IPB size from 64 bits back to 128 bits
    in montgomery_sqrt.c. Something mysterious is going on there
    that really should be further investigated, but basically
    it seems that the CRT lift was failing in some cases, even
    where all the residues are 1 (i.e., probably a variable
    containing the number of moduli was being corrupted somewhere,
    and so the function was using an undefined residue/modulus
    combination somewhere). It seems to only have added about
    8% or so to the runtime, so it's not too big of a deal. But
    I would like to know exactly what was going on there.
  * Included Eric's improvements to the classical siever.

0.72.11, 1/24/05
  * Fixed some typos (year numbers) in this Changelog :)
  * Added a quick self-test of the matrix multiplication code
    in blanczos64.c ; it's not very thorough - it simply tests
    for linearity of the product (which is unlikely to occurr
    in the event of a serious coding error).
  * Changed matsolve.c to seed the PRNG with the clock by default,
    and output the seed used to the logfile and stdout. I believe
    this to be a fix to the matsolve failures (i.e., they may still
    occur from time to time, but should be fixed by simply re-running
    with a different seed).

0.72.10, 1/22/05
  * I believe I've fixed the SNFS difficulty calculation in
    the Perl script to correctly work for the non-monic linear
    polynomial case also. A back-of-envelope calculation suggests
    that it should simply be about the size of f_1(Y0), where f_1 is
    the non-linear polynomial.

0.72.9, 1/18/05
  * Moved the even-number-of-relations bit to a different
    column; something funny seems to have happened and I had
    some dependencies with an odd number of relations (probably
    somewhere it says qcb size = 62, so that it might have missed
    the bit where it was??)
  * Included some fixes from Sam:
    * Various things in the Perl script, mostly for multi-client support.
    * Fixed a memory initialization at line 662 of combparts.c.
    * Some typos corrected in def-par.txt.
    * Added a test to the division at line 2307 of montgomery_sqrt.c
      to make sure the division was exact.
  * Small change in nfmisc.c : line 232, an unnecessary test was removed.

0.72.8, 1/18/05
  * A small fix to montgomery_sqrt.c for non-monic polynomials was
    needed. It seems to be okay now, at least in more cases than
    before. It is possible that there are still some things that
    might make it fail for general numbers, but one can hope :)
  * Another small fix to rels.c to properly compute the sign bit
    (for monic linear polynomial, it didn't matter - we could safely
    assume it to always be negative; but for non-monic linear,
    the sign bit really does matter).
  * Fixed the Perl script to match the new method of controlling
    cycle counting in procrels.

0.72.7, 12/19/04
  * Changed runPolyselect in the Perl script to start off
    with smaller coefficient divisors after a couple of experiments
    (in the c110 range) suggested that this would be a good idea.
  * Probably some other changes which I forgot to document
    (I am uploading this version today, 1/12/05). But it still
    does not fix several known bugs. I have even witnessed a failure
    on the tst250 test case in matsolve (it subsequently worked
    when re-run with a different value for the -wt option).

0.72.6, 12/19/04
  * Included Brian's VC updates as well as a suggested fix of my
    mpqs-hack.c fix, and some mods to the Perl script so it can
    report the commands that are being issued.
  * Changed the default value of maxRelsInFF in the Perl script
    from 40 to 32, to give (by default) slightly sparser matrices
    at the expense of a little extra sieving.

0.72.5, 12/18/04
  * Some more PPC fixes from Mark.
  * A fix to mpqs-hack.c - somebody had suggested it a week ago
    or so, and I forgot to check it out. But then Brian sent in
    the same suggestion, so I stopped and looked and it and it did
    need a fix around line 1171 of mpqs-hack.c; I added another
    check at the first 'if' to see if there's room for more
    mpqs survivors in the array.
  * Another small tweak to the square root code - some of the LLL
    calls did not need the transition matrix, so they now pass
    a NULL value for that pointer, saving a little bit of uneeded
    work.

0.72.4, 12/15/04
  * Another PPC #include fixed/
  * A small fix to readPoly() to allow no space between the
    token and value. Also added a couple of stderr messages to
    this function to be somewhat more informative of failures.
  * Added periodic output of the current special-q by the lattice
    siever, as a workaround for the failure of the Cygwin version
    to catch interrupt signals. This probably still doesn't work
    quite right, as I seem to remember that the Cygwin version doesn't
    properly parse the '-n' option for some reason. So another easy
    fix should still be needed, but I don't have a Cyg box handy at the
    moment to see what it needs.
  * Some more tweaks to montgomerySqrt() to avoid the cycling effect
    that is happening sometimes. I think there is something funny going
    on in this code still which is causing it to run a bit slower than
    it should (in particular, either the denominator step or the numerator
    step might be funny). But it seems to work fine now.

0.72.3, 12/15/04
  * Changed the default value of discFact in sqrt.c, so that
    the program will not try hard to factor the discriminant.
  * Sam pointed out that lpF.numFiles should be initialized to
    zero, not 4.
  * Included some more of Mark's patches for PPC compilation.


0.72.2, 12/14/04
  * Increased MAX_RAT_FACTORS, MAX_ALG_FACTORS and MAX_SP_FACTORS :
    Bob hit a snag with the old values being too small for some number.
    It doesn't affect memory allocation, so no biggy.
  * Made a change to matsolve so that it can recover from a small
    number of bad columns by simply deleting them. This is untested
    at the moment.
  * Slightly increased the number of primes sieved with in the
    poly selection code. Result: slight increase in runtime, slightly
    better polynomials sometimes.
  * Slight change to runPolyselect in the Perl script, to further restrict
    the conditions under which it will refine the search. I think it was
    often refining itself too much too soon before. This stuff still is
    nowhere near perfect, though - one should almost always be able to get
    better polys when the program is run manually by a skilled hand.
  * Fixed some initializations in sqrt.c and procrels.c pointed
    out by José. He also suggests removing the mpqs assembly files from
    the VC project because they define some of the same global symbols,
    causing incorrect linking (i.e., no linking error, but the resulting
    executable is broken).
  * Included some new files and diffs from Mark for PPC compilation;
    I did the diffs by hand, though, and so I'm sure I probably messed
    some of them up. Hopefully, any such mistakes will be corrected by
    the next version.

0.72.1, 12/10/04
  * Summary output of the perl script is now sent to a file
    whose name depends on the number factored. For example,
       g104-al.txt
    would be the output name for a general c104 for which I
    was using the name `al'. For SNFS factorizations, the
    file will be named with the SNFS difficulty level instead
    of the number of digits of the actual divisors that was
    being factored.
  * Fixed the -speedtest option for procrels (used by the Perl
    script to get some rough idea how fast a machine is). It
    spits out something which is called `timeunit', but it
    was inversely wrong before: it is supposed to be representative
    of how much work a machine can do in a given unit of time.
    Poorly names, perhaps, but this is what the Perl script expects
    the number to represent. As a result, the `scaled time' reported
    by the Perl script was wrong by a factor inversely proportional
    to the speed of the machine (i.e., if it doubled the actual time,
    it should have halved the actual time instead). No big deal since
    I haven't used this yet and nobody seems to have noticed that it's
    there yet (of course, it's necessarily inaccurate anyway, since
    the scale factor can be way off if another process is running
    while the time scale is being computed. But when these `scaled
    times' are averaged out in the long run, it shouldn't matter much.
    Especially if the same process happened to be running during
    much of the factorization, in which case it has cancelling effect
    anyway).

0.72.0, 12/10/04
  * Fixed a small bug, pointed out by Bob, in the perl script
    that wound up passing the entire m: xxxxxx line to the log
    function.
  * Added a snippet to procrels.c to detect the condition when
    there are no valid relations after addNewRelations5() has been
    called. This happens as a result of bad parameter choices or
    invalid usage; previously, this would result in a segfault -
    now, a brief message is printed follwed by a graceful exit.
  * Some changes to runPolyselect() in the Perl script, so that it's
    a bit smarter about honing in on particular ranges of coefficient
    size. It will now remember the leading coefficient of the best
    poly found so far, and use that to decide whether or not to
    further refine the search in some range (i.e., if it finds a
    new best score which comes from a poly which was already found,
    it will not refine again).

0.71.9, 12/9/04
  * Small change to src/lasieve4/piii/mpqs.c suggested by Brian
    for VC compilation. While I was in there, though, I removed
    some unused junk leftover from an earlier hack of this file.
  * Included new VC project files from Brian.
  * Started including Mark R.'s changes for PPC compilation -
    he's taking it easy on me and sending the required changes
    in increments, so it will be a while before all the necessary
    stuff is in here for an actual PPC compile.

0.71.8, 12/8/04
  * More changes to factLat.pl : some suggested by Sam (better
    parsing of input - some of the digit counts were probably
    wrong before), some by Steve (concerning the multi-box mode).
    Also, the script will now add `q1' to the job file in a commented-out
    line (purely for convenence - there's no associated functionality).
  * Another fix suggested by Sam - the problems allowing the
    script to run polyselect under Cygwin should now be gone
    (my boneheaded error - I forgot to close a file).
  * I think there might have been another small change or two
    which I've forgotten - but nothing major.

0.71.7, 12/8/04
  * Changed factLat.pl : square roots are run exactly until all
    prime factors have been found. It's not very smart, though:
    it waits until sqrt reports all the prime divisors. If we
    had a primality test in Perl (perhaps there is on in the
    BigInt module??), we could do a little better by doing some
    gcd and divisions to stop a bit sooner. I think, worst case,
    though, is that the script will run 2 or 3 more square roots
    than strictly needed. A side-effect of this change is that
    if the factLat.pl script is run in a directory where an entire
    factorization has been completed, it will probably skip all
    steps through to the summary-generation code.
      Note that none of these changes have ben extensively tested!

0.71.6, 12/8/04
  * Changed the test for detecting convergence failure in the
    square root code.
  * Some changes suggested by Bob to the screen output formatting
    in polyselect.
  * Added the 'type' field to the test numbers' poly files.
  * Fixed a bug in the multi-box hack of the Perl script that
    caused machines to choose identical sieving ranges under
    some circumstances.


0.71.5, 12/4/04
  * Modified the Perl script to preceed it's stdout output with
    '->' to make it easier to see which output is coming from
    the script, versus the GGNFS binaries.
  * Included Anton's fix of ll_getsortOnFieldSize() - it avoids
    the sort altogether, and so is faster and more reliable than
    before.
  * Included Sam's suggestion for abbreviating the `speedtest' code
    in the Perl script.
  * Included Robert's fix to the Perl script to get the stdout
    stuff straight.
  * Implemented Steve's suggestion that the Perl script should make
    unique job/spairs files when running in multi-client mode.
    I haven't tested it yet, though, so it could be broken.
    Also, by Steve's suggestion, any secondary clients will now
    die if/when a `deps' file appears.

0.71.4, 12/4/04
  * It's been a busy day for bugfixes - I fixed yet another boneheaded
    bug in the Perl script that messed up sieving ranges.

0.71.3, 12/4/04
  * Made another change to checkAB() in procrels.c. I think I fixed
    another bug that was causing the speed to slow down quickly.
    But it hasn't yet been tested on a large number of relations,
    so there could still be some funny stuff with it. I just moved the
    code for merging abExtraList with the abList.

0.71.2, 12/3/04
  * Fixed readBinField() in misc.c to check for EOF condition while
    reading input.
  * Fixed a bug in the Perl script which messed up the sieving ranges
    after an interrupt.

0.71.1, 12/3/04
  * Fixed a bug in blanczos.c : in MultB64() and MultB_T64(),
    it was possible for some memory to be erroneously overwritten.
    This is the likely cause of the error where Lanczos wouldn't
    terminate. It's possible that this caused some other errors as
    well, but I also think that some error still might remain in
    matstuff.c.

0.71.0, 12/3/04.
  * Coded up a better method of computing the valuations of
    <a-b\alpha> at the special primes, to take advantage of the
    facts that:
      (1) This is a principal ideal.
      (2) The generator is linear in \alpha.
    Previously, we were computing the valuations using the general
    case algorithm in Cohen, but this is much much faster for the
    special case. The net result is a speedup of maybe 8x or so
    for relation processing on general numbers.
  * A fix and some bells (but no whistles) added to the factLat.pl
    script.
  * Fixed a bug in that abHash code which caused relation processing
    to unnecessarily slow down (we weren't using all of the allocated
    memory for the hash, and I think we failed to completely zero out
    abExtraHash when that stuff was added to the long list. It was
    a silly counting error on my part).

0.70.9, 12/2/04
  * Added a small hack to the Perl script to that I can conveniently
    sieve on several machines at once. This hack is very temporary,
    untested so far, and I don't encourage using it! If it doesn't
    work right for you, I will accept suggestions for a fix, but I
    won't track down bugs byself, since it's only intended to be a
    temporary hack. A longterm method will have to be far more robust.
    Note: this hack assumes a reasonably homogenous network of
    machines - it just blindly divides sieving regions up equally.

0.70.8, 12/1/04
  * Added Greg's tweak to the Perl script to allow the non-monic
    linear polynomial. Ran it with his test case, and everything
    worked fine.
  * One more fix for Cyg compilation.

0.70.7, 12/1/04
  * 24 days till Christmas!
  * Added a prototype and another hack to piii/mpqs.c for Cygwin
    compilation.

0.70.6, 11/30/04
  * Again, fixed printTmp() : Sam pointed out that there was an unnecessary loop.
  * I hacked up the pure-C version of Franke's mpqs code for factoring the
    leftover stuff after sieving. I used this to replace the rho code which
    was doing the same job. However, MPQS failures (which are rare), are handled
    by the rho code (instead of simply giving up on them).
  * A couple of small changes in nfmisc.c to speed up relation processing
    by a tiny bit. Much more is needed there - the time to compute valuations
    at ramified primes is unbearable!
  * Changed exponent selection during square root initialization, to use a
    greedy strategy (before, it just alternated exponents :). On tst250, the
    net result is about a 50% speedup.
  * Added Montgomery's trick for the ideal quotients during the square root
    step - this gained another 40-50% or so (at the current LLL_max level;
    when LLL_max is greater, the gain will probably be greater as well).
    Between these two improvements, tst250 sqrt time was dropped from 108 seconds
    to about 35 seconds.

0.70.5, 11/29/04
  * Included Tomoya Adachi's patch to allow non-monic linear polynomials.
    This is a huge help!
  * Started updating some of the default parameters in def-par.txt file
    to figures actually obtained through testing, instead of the completely
    guessed ones that were there (I haven't gotten very far yet - only the
    gnfs-80 and gnfs-90 figures are better now, but 90 is still not
    done).

0.70.4, 11/29/04
  * Modified the Perl script to detect special-q above lpba. Note that this
    occurs only if the initial choice of parameters was far from optimal.
  * Fixed a bug in the discriminant factoring code, which sometimes caused
    a failure to compute the ramified primes (symptom: procrels would report
    failure on nearly all relations).
  * Added a workaround to factLat.pl since chomp doesn't remove both CR/LF
    under Windows.
  * Added code to factLat.pl to so slightly more sophisticated polynomial
    searches. It dynamically selects a leading coefficient divisor based on
    the size of the number, and will back it down to a smaller one when
    it hits a region which seems to have some good polys (i.e., which
    probably means a nice balance between size of poly and size of 'm',
    and so that region should be searched at a finer level of detail).
    This change hasn't been heavily tested yet, but so far it appears to
    be better. The exact choices of leading coefficient divisors will surely
    need to be adjusted after more testing.
  * Fixed polyselect.c so that only polynomials meeting the cutoff are
    appended to the all.poly file. This should help keep the size down and
    thus allow for running polyselect over smaller ranges from the Perl
    script (otherwise the filesize would have grown out of control).
  * Used Sam/Mark's suggestions to fix up printTmp() in misc.c.
  * Ditto for the fix at/around lines 298-299 of mpz_poly.c.
  * Change to polyselect, so that when it finds a new `best', it uses a larger
    sample size to estimate the small prime contribution (should result in
    more accurate scores on top candidates, when run in small chunks as from
    the Perl script).

0.70.3, 11/27/04
  * Fixed polyselect so that it outputs the newly required 'type: gnfs'
    line as well.

0.70.2, 11/25/04
  * Added some code to the Perl script to automagically run polyselect
    if a polynomial is not found. It will also automatically choose
    parameters from a table (but the table is not yet complete, so I
    don't encourage using this `feature' until the table is completed).
    It will also automatically choose parameters for SNFS numbers, though
    the user still must supply the polynomial and 'm' value.
      When the table of parameters is refined and completed, this should
    make the software much easier to run. Everything is still fine
    tuneable by the advanced user (the default parameters are always
    selected, and then overridden by any user-supplied parameters).
      One change in the script that will affect everyone is that there is
    a new field which must be in the poly file:
      type: <gnfs|snfs>
    In a couple of places, it is convenient for the script to know if this
    is a GNFS or SNFS factorization (among other reasons, it chooses the
    appropriate lattice siever automatically).
      I also added a timescale feature to procrels and the script, to make
    it easier to compare timings from summary.txt files. When the def-par.txt
    table is more complete, it should also contain average values of these
    scaled timings for the given parameter choices, so that we can more
    easily decide if one set of parameters is better than those in the table
    (this table will be very dynamic for a while, as it will take much testing
    to determine the best parameter choices on average).
  * In an earlier release, I made a change I forgot to document.
    matsolve now spits out a number it calls 'matrix difficulty'.
    This number represents, oddly enough, the difficulty of solving
    the resulting matrix. It is a function of both the matrix size,
    the number of sparse entries and the number of dense blocks. This
    makes it much easier to compare Lanczos optimizations and for folks
    to see why some 400Kx400K matrices may solve fairly quickly (say,
    3 or 4 hours), while others need much longer (say 20 hours). There
    are some ways to control the density of the matrix by choosing smarter
    parameters and oversieving and such. I'll say more about this when
    I get around to writing up proper documentation for the whole thing.
  * Fixed the LPBR output error in factLat.pl and cleaned up a bunch
    of sloppy code (though there is no doubt that much of what remains
    is still sloppy - this is the only real Perl code I've ever written,
    so I'm sure guru's would find much of what I've written 'unacceptable').
    Thanks to Sam for pointing out the most serious problems and the -w flag.
  * Also changed the memalign stuff in blanczos64.c for MingW32 compilation
    and changed some return values in sqrt.c as a workaround for a known
    Windows Perl bug. Thanks again to Sam for suggesting these fixes.
  * Took Bob's suggestion for printing out the divisors in sorted order
    in the factLat.pl script.
  * Removed the tests/old directory which contained the Bash script; by now,
    I hope everyone is using the Perl script which is far more robust.
  * Fixed the top-level Makefile; there was some knuckleheaded dependency
    in it that would often cause compilation to fail from the toplevel
    (because it would try to compile src/*.c files from the toplevel without
    using the src/Makefile).
  * Reverted part of the square root code back to machine-precision computations
    and increased LLL_max back to 10^200 to get some speed back - I think
    it was unnecessarily backed down before (the problem was the ordering of
    the special prime ideals - not lost precision).
  * Updated the tex file documentation, but it still needs much more work.

0.70.1, 11/18/04
  * Added a workaround (hack) to take care of the ``Could not
    find large xxxxxx prime'' error. This is a bug which needs
    to be properly tracked down. So far, I _believe_ it has
    only been witnessed properly on Cygwin boxes (this message
    can also be caused by corrupted data files; I know the
    message has been seen on Linux boxes, but as far as I can tell
    all of those instances were actually caused by corrupted
    data files from bugs in other versions or from mixing versions
    of GGNFS on the same run).
      Anyway, the message will still appear when this bug crops
    up, but it will be safely dealt with instead of the program
    simply bailing out as it did before.
  * Added a new command-line option to procrels: -maxrelsinff <int>.
    This is for those ever-annoying situations where the matrix
    you wind up with is too dense to fit into RAM. In this case,
    supply a smaller number (the default is 48 - try 32 or 24,
    for example). You will likely have to do more sieving than you
    otherwise would have, but when you do get enough FF's, the
    resulting matrix will be sparser. I am currently testing this
    option with a general c118 I have for which the resulting
    matrix won't fit into the 512MB on my laptop.
  * Added a new parameter to combParts(), so that it won't bother
    with doing the weight reduction unless there are possibly
    enough full relation-sets.
  * Some tweaks to the relation-set weight reduction code to speed
    it up a bit (at the expense of possibly missing a tiny fraction
    of possible weight reductions). I may be able to push this a
    bit and speed it up much more, but it will require some testing
    to make sure that we aren't missing too many of these reductions.

0.70.0, 11/17/04
  * No change - I just decided that this version should finally
    be somewhat stable for moderate sized numbers, and finally
    ready for a version number upgrade.

0.61.5, 11/17/04
  * Added code to sort the special ideals after they're found.
    This seems to be what was causing the square root problems
    on Cygwin (i.e., they were reported in different orders
    at different times, resulting in the mis-indexing of some
    factorization data).
  * Added a snippet of code to procrels to report factorization
    of a specific relation. This should help debug such situations
    should they arise again in the future.
  * #define'd out stdint.h in one of the lattice siever header files
    for Win boxes. Apparently, MS chose to not include this (standard)
    header file.

0.61.4, 11/15/04
  * Changed posix_memalign() calls to memalign(), for
    Cygwin compatibility.
  * Fixed asm_mul64.S for Cygwin (it needed underscores).
  * Changes and Windows fixes to the Perl script.
  * Some small tweaks to montgomery_sqrt.c - there is likely
    still a problem with it for large factorizations, but I am
    going to try to debug this with Rod; he has an RSA-130 factorization
    which is stuck at the square root step because of this bug.
    It may be the case that all of the floating point arithmetic
    needs to be converted over to multi-precision, but this remains
    to be seen (I don't think that this _should_ be necessary, so I'm
    holding off on it for now).
  * Updated with Brian Gladman's latest VC++ files.
  * Changes to blanczos64.c for VC++ compatability.

0.61.3, 11/7/04
  * Threw a hack into factLat.pl to allow lattice sieving below
    the AFB limit. This definitely should result in a sparser matrix,
    and I think it should make large factorizations at least a little
    bit faster.

0.61.2, 11/5/04
  * Removed some debug flags that were accidentally left on in Makefiles.
  * Added the other-arch subdirectories back into lasieve4 - they were
    accidentally deleted.

0.61.1, 11/5/04
  * Re-fixed the lambda >= 2 problem. This was caused by a MingW32 fix
    which broke asm_mul64.s on Linux/Cygwin. Anyway, this has been fixed.
  * I have reluctantly included some of my test MMX code in blanczos64.c.
    This is really just some test stuff, while I learn some more of the
    ins-and-outs of gcc inline assembly. I am also looking for a _good_ SSE2
    tutorial; if anybody knows of one, I'd appreciate hearing about it.
    I would like to get the Lanczos code at least twice as fast on a
    single P4 or Athlon XP as it is now. I will then move on to MPI-izing
    it. I will retain a pure-C version of it, but the push is definitely
    going to be toward assembly to juice more speed from it.
  * Incorporated Anton's MingW32 fixes. Also, implemented his suggestion
    to have readRels() report some status information since it can sometimes
    take so much time.
  * Made some changes to the factLat.pl script, suggested by Greg.
  * Fixed the ``cheap fix'' from 0.60.9-unstable, which had broken the
    duplicate relation filtering. The problem: I forgot to multiply
    some stupid variable by two. Doh!
    from procrels.c, line 1281:
      memcpy(abList+2*abListSize, abExtra, abExtraSize*2*sizeof(s32));
                    ^
    While I was in there, though, I happened to find another problem
    with the initialization of those ab hash tables. I am suprised that
    it hadn't caused a problem with duplicate relations, but the same
    file around line 1325 or so was wrong: it failed to add each existing
    (a,b) pair to both tables.

0.60.9-unstable, 10/29/04
  * Found a cheap fix for the quadratic slowdown of relation
    processing on files containing a large number of new
    relations. It hasn't been heavily tested, but it seems to
    be ok. The new code (in case of crash) is around line 1270
    of procrels.c.
  * I finally got around to trying out some -march flags, and found
    that with gcc 3.3.3, I get a bit of a boost on my Athlon 2800+ XP laptop
    by giving -march=athlon (for procrels, at least). Of course, this won't
    speed up the lattice siever since it's already assembly coded, but at
    least a little boost for relation processing is worth it.
    This probably means its time for a proper configure script, but I
    don't have time for that yet. In the meantime, I added a
    Makefile.athlon for this. I suspect that various pentium flags may also
    help, so you may want to experiment with this.

0.60.8-unstable, 10/22/04
  * Small change to the lattice sieving code so that the
    siever logs the time it spent sieving. I needed this
    to better time beowulf runs.

0.60.6-unstable, 10/21/04
  * Removed the re-seeding of the PRNG in polyselect, as pointed out
    by J.Bass.
  * As a first step toward some 64-bit compatibility, I went through
    and changed all 'long' to 's32' and' unsigned long' to 'u32'.
    The next step is to carefully go through the code and see what
    really needs to be s32 and what can be u32 (i.e., in all post-sieving
    code, so that we can handle large primes upto 32 bits).


0.60.5-unstable, 10/21/04
  * Fixed up the 64-bit Lanczos code. It still needs to be cleaned
    up a bit and it is probably no faster than the 32-bit code right
    now, but it will be. Anyway, it seems to work.

0.60.4-unstable, 10/19/04
  * Fixed a bug that caused procrels to segfault.
  * Fixed a bug in the Lanczos code which caused wrong
    matrix multiplication.
  * Fixed and tweaked the matrix pruning code - it was always
    leaning too heavily toward removing heavy rows because of
    some bad formulae.

0.60.3-unstable, 10/17/04
  * Tweaked gnfs-lasieve4e.c and the factLat.pl script
    to:
    (1) Automatically resume sieving from the exact place where
        it was interrupted, when killed with CTRL-C. Previously,
        it would resume from wherever the previous job was started.
        Now it will resume from where the previous job was stopped.
    (2) Allow parameter changes mid-factorization. This is not
        thoroughly tested, but it appears to work. If you want to
        change factor base sizes or large prime limits, simply
        kill the script, change the parameters in the .poly file,
        and restart the script. It will have to re-process all relations,
        so this may take a bit of time if you have alot of relations.
        Also be aware that if you decrease factor base limits or
        large prime limits, you will see many invalid relations
        during re-processing, as it will have to throw some out due
        to the decreased limits.

0.60.2-unstable, 10/15/04
  * Changed the NFS_HASH() macro again, so that it will
    uniformly distribute relations across the rels.bin files.
    It should be ok now.

0.60.1-unstable, 10/14/04
  * Fixed a naughty little bug that caused a miscount of the
    total number of large primes in procrels (net result was a
    memory allocation error).

0.60-unstable, 10/13/04
  * Deleted most of the files from include-extra, which seem not to be
    needed anymore. I guessed at the syntax of the VC files and tried
    to comment out the corresponding lines. Hopefully I didn't break it.
    But I think I moved some files around which probably broke it anyway.
    I should probably consider asking someone (Brian :) to keep a copy
    of the VC files somewhere else and I'll link to them. What keeps happening
    is that by the time I get to include the updates, I've already changed
    things so that they are broken by the time they get included.
  * I finally started debugging the lasieve/lambda problem. My suspicion
    was (of course :) right, that it was crashing when it attempted to
    MPQS a leftover norm. Most likely, this is due to some error on my
    part during the translation & incorporation process. For now, I fixed
    this by replacing the mpqs call with a Pollard-rho call. This is probably
    substantially slower than with mpqs, so it should be fixed at some point.
    I looked briefly at the assembly to try and pinpoint the problem and I did
    manage to find some problems, but I still couldn't quite nail them all.
    The options left to us are (in order of preference):
      (1) Do what it takes to debug the mpqs stuff (possibly starting from the
        original code might help).
      (2) Make a fast SQUFOF implementation and use it to replace the rho code.
      (3) Radically speed up the rho code.
  * In any case, there is no some more flexibility in how we can use the lattice
    siever. Lambda values larger than 2 will no longer crash it. Doing this
    results in relations with upto 2 or 3 large primes on each side. As a result,
    I made some tweaks to the rest of GGNFS so it can handle 3 large primes from
    each side. This means faster factorization on larger numbers. I am testing
    it now and it seems to be ok. (But I don't know if I'd try any very large
    ones with it yet).
  * Modified the factLat.sh script a bit more. It now has a built in parameter
    for `over-sieving', to generate extra relations to help get the pruned matrix
    smaller.
  * Anton reported that GGNFS now (0.54.5b) appears to work under MingW32, at least
    for the F7 test case.
  * I ported the factLat.sh script over to Perl for several reasons:
    (1) The camel is cool.
    (2) To make life a bit easier on Windows non-Cygwin folks. My understanding
        is that they can, in theory, install a working Perl environment
        easier than a bash shell.
    (3) At some point, this script may become a robust factorization controller,
        with the ability to control several nodes. This will require some level
        of network communication capabilities which Perl has but Bash does not
        (at least, not via any reasonably clean techniques that I know).
    (4) I want to learn Perl. Not a bad start I think, though I'm sure
        I broke some style rules.
    (5) It should be a transparent change for Linux users since we all
        have Perl anyway. So why not?
    (6) In general, there is just much more capability in Perl. So there
        is potential now add all sorts of interesting capabilities.
  * Added a 'dump' option to getdeps to recover siever-formatted relations
    from processed relation files. This is to help with debugging, or restarting
    a factorization with different FB sizes without the need to re-sieve
    (of course, this can also be done by turning on the SAVE_PAIRS flag in
    the scripts, but on several occasions I've left it off and wished I
    could recover the siever output. Now I can! :)
  * Modified the Lanczos code to use u32/s32 types instead of long. This
    is in preparation for writing some decent 64 or 128 bit Lanczos code.
  * Started fixing getdeps.c. It is far too slow and uses far too much RAM.
    I have rewritten the duplicate-checking stuff, so it should be much
    faster and more RAM-friendly than the old method. (It remains to be
    tested on an interesting sized number, though, to see if this is
    actualy the case). I also started pulling apart some of the code
    responsible for the scattered disk-access which was slowing the program
    to a crawl when working on large numbers. The problem is the same one
    that KAMADA fixed in addNewRelations() - reading/writing little bits
    at a time inside of often-repeated loops. This is being done away
    with by reading/writing to a RAM buffer which is filled/dumped as needed.
    I'm not yet done - I've only done the disk writing so far (which is
    the easy part :)
  * Modified the factLat.pl script to also kick out a jpeg showing the FF's as
    a function of the total relations.
  * (MAJOR CHANGE) : The old `getdeps' program and source file are now called
    `procrels', which makes far more sense. The old name, getdeps, was a reminant
    from the early days of GGNFS when this program did both relation processing
    and matrix solving. I have adjusted the scripts to reflect this change.
  * Slightly smarter cycle-building. It will now build cycles with upto 1.5*MAX_RELS_IN_FF
    relations per relation set. It then goes through and attempts to combine
    relation-sets to reduce the weights of relation-sets before going back through
    and tossing out any that still have more than MAX_RELS_IN_FF. The net result
    should be both more full relation-sets and a (at least slightly) sparser
    matrix. This remains to be extensively tested though.
  * Added a new command-line parameter to matsolve to allow varying strategies
    for density vs. dimension of the final matrix.


0.54.5/b, 9/22/04
  * Incorporated Brian Gladman's VC diffs, which sadly might be
    broken already :( I decided that all of the 32-bit Lanczos
    stuff should be in one file, so I combined the needed parts
    of spmatmul.c into blanczos32.c and removed spmatmul.c.
    Note that the directory with the VC files has changed from
    vc_project to ggnfs.vc.)
   (Nope - it's fixed now. I sent it to Brian first and he updated
    the files).
  * Added a new parameter, `examinefrac', to the polyselect input
    file. This parameter gives a criterion by which polynomials
    are initially filtered out if the 3rd coefficient is too large.
    At some point, I did also add a c_3 parameter to the Montgomery-Murphy
    code, and I just realized I probably didn't mention it earlier.
    Anyway, the polyselect program is now fairly decent, if run properly.
  * Changed a few more fopen() calls to add the "b" flag as well,
    for Windows compatibility.
  * Modified the factLat.sh script to put all the relevent info and
    parameters in the summary file. This should make it easier to keep
    track of factorizations, timings and parameter choices.

0.54.4, 9/16/04
  * Fixed another bug in the square root code. This bug was due
    to the bad practice of computing logarithms of mpz_t's by:
      log(mpz_get_d(k));
    The problem is that on large factorizations, some of the intermediate
    numbers involved seemed to overflow past what the exponent
    part of a double can handle. The net result is that the return
    value would sometimes be 'inf', throwing everything else way off.
    It might be the case that there are other chunks of the code
    suffering from the same problem. At some point, I should hunt them
    all down and replace with calls to the new function _mpz_log(),
    defined in misc.c.


0.54.3, 9/14/04
  * Increased MAX_ALIM and MAX_RLIM from 10^7 to 10^8 : I guess
    some people are experimenting with some larger GNFS numbers
    and this limitation caused segfaults instead of clean exits
    when one tried to use a larger limit for the factor bases.
  * Fixed one small bug and added some more debugging code to
    montgomery_sqrt.c. There may or may not still be some bugs
    linerging around in the sqrt code - I'm now in wait-and-see
    mode to see if the bug I found is the only one that has been
    causing problems.

0.54.2, 9/12/04
  * Some work on polyselect has been incorporated. It's not
    yet done and I really didn't intend to release it yet,
    but it seems to be somewhat stable.

  * Some bugfixes submitted by KAMADA Makoto were implemented:
    *Correction:
    GGNFS 0.54.1 src/getdeps.c line 703:
      RL->maxDataSize = fileInfo.st_size;
    should be
      RL->maxDataSize = fileInfo.st_size / sizeof(long);

    Description:
    There is a mismatch of the unit between source and destination.
      (src) fileInfo.st_size ... bytes
      (dst) RL->maxDataSize ... longs

    Result:
    After the correction, large waste memory -- more than 300MB? -- has been saved.

    *Correction:
    GGNFS 0.54.1 src/rels.c line 398:
          bufSize += fread(&buf[bufSize], sizeof(long), bufMax-bufIndex-10, fp);
    should be
          bufSize += fread(&buf[bufSize], sizeof(long), bufMax-bufSize, fp);

    Description:
    It's a simple mistake. fread() overruns memory blocks and causes segfaults on
Cygwin.

0.54.1, 9/8/04
  * Ditched some of the extra output that had been added to `sqrt'
    for debugging.

0.54.0, 9/8/04
  * Hammered out another square root bug. I hope this was the last
    one (it is definitely the last one of which I'm aware). The problem
    was stupid, really: If the final residue from Montgomery's method
    happened to have a denominator different from 1 when expressed in
    terms of the power basis, the code was neglecting it. The fix is just
    to multiply by the square of the discriminant prior to the square root,
    then divide out by the discriminant after the square root is done.

0.53.4, 9/8/04
  * Modified addNewRelations4 in getdeps.c so it doesn't try to read
    the whole input file at once. Instead, it will be read by chunks
    of 4MB or so at a time. This should save some memory when getdeps
    is run with a large spairs.out file.
  * makefb now outputs an error message and dies if the coeffficients
    of the algebraic polynomial have a nontrivial gcd.
  * I think I finally nailed the main matrix bug. Well, kinda. It seems
    to be caused by the new function removeSingletons2() in matstuff.c,
    which was used to replace removeSingletons(). It's a pretty straightforward
    function, and for all my efforts I still can't figure out exactly why
    it fails, but it does (sometimes). The symptom is that many non-singleton
    columns are deleted. So what was happening to many people is that it
    would delete too many columns, leaving an underdetermined matrix, and
    Lanczos would wind up running forever on it.
  * Implemented some suggestions of Kamada Makoto & Greg Childers:
    * getdeps condition for running cycle finding code modified to something
      which seems to work better (we're all tired of waiting for me to get off
      my can and do the heuristics, but this seems to work pretty well).
    * sqrt now returns -1,0 or 1 depending on whether or not the number was
      not factored, partially factored or completely factored respectively.
    * The factlat.sh script was modified to allow several additional square
      root jobs in the case where a number was not completely factored (i.e.,
      at least one of the divisors found was composite).
  * Started messing with polyselect.c. It's probably no better right now,
    but it is a little cleaner and shouldn't have the stall-bug that people
    witnessed (I never saw it myself, but I did see something funny that might
    have caused it).
  * KAMADA Makoto submitted a fix for a nasty little bug in llist.c which
    caused segfaults on Cygwin (and probably some headaches on linux as well,
    though none were reported). Many thanks to KAMADA!

0.53.3, 8/23/04
  * A couple more little bugs were hammered out with the
    help of Electric Fence and gdb. Some of them should have
    caused segfaults, but probably not the matrix bug (incidentally,
    I think this is another bug only witnessed under Cygwin so far,
    but there is still another bug remaining which is in the sqrt
    code - Rod and I have both witnessed it, but I mistakenly thought
    it was the same as the current matrix bug which causes Lanczos
    to not terminate. The latter bug is most likely some problem with
    the new method of grouping dense rows up. I don't yet have any
    real idea about the square root bug, but I think it coincides with
    an early deviation of the algebraically-measured norm from the
    numerically computed one; this is the difference reported by the
    sqrt program that looks like:
      step 3315, sl=-1, logGam=673671.49/673897.33, \
           emb: -60.38 -47.55 -47.55 -35.17 -35.17 , diff=- 0.0000
    Here, the final quantity is the one I'm talking about. It _should_ always
    stay fairly close to zero, but it sometimes jumps after the first iteration.
    This seems to indicate that somewhere we are dividing or multiplying
    by a different ideal than we adjust the exponents by.)

0.53.2, 8/21/04
  * Some little changes to matrix stuff: there were two seperate
    defines, MAX_ROWS_IN_COL and MAXCOLWT which should have been
    the same, and now they are. But I don't believe this caused
    anyone any problems, because they are both large enough that
    nobody should have reached them.

0.53.1, 8/17/04
  * Made some more modifications to the factRel.sh script.
    The new script now expects all parameters for the factorization
    to be in the poly file, including RFB/AFB limits, large-prime
    sizes, lambdas,...
      Additionally, the part of the script responsible for creating
    a job file has been seperated out to a bash function.
     The idea is that:
    (1) At some point, polyselect may become smart enough to
    at least suggest some parameters. In that case, it would only
    make sense to record them with the polynomial.
    (2) In principle, one might want to tweak the script to just
    produce some job files which can be sent out to worker nodes.
    This should be much easier with the current setup.
    (3) One does not have to modify the script for each factorization.
    Instead, use the same script for all factorizations (i.e., none
    of the parameters are hardcoded into the script!)
    Note: I may consider migrating this script over to Perl at some
    point to allow the script to send job files to worker nodes
    via sockets. This is not high on my priority list at the moment,
    but it is fairly easy to do from the server side, given the current
    script. It also shouldn't take much work on the client side.
    It would just be a matter of adding a few lines of code to the siever to
    query a server for a job file (if run in client mode).
    If it gets one, dump it to file and everything proceeds as normal.
    If it did not get one, the siever will shutdown, after complaining
    about not finding a job file. The hard part of this will be getting
    the siever to properly restart after completing a job.
  * Made some changes to polyselect so that it spits out a template
    (in the 'best.poly' file only) for what is expected by the
    new script.

0.53.0, 8/16/04
  * KAMADA Makoto submitted another patch which fixed the serious
    Cygwin bug and further sped up addNewRelations4() by another
    18% or so. Many thanks to Makoto for his hard work in tracking
    that bug down and speeding up the various functions in getdeps.c.
